# React-virtual-scroll Sandboxes

Minimal self-contained samples designed to be loaded into [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). I can only get CodeSandbox to launch correctly if the entry point is a `*.js` file, even if it contains JSX. Use a URL of the form `https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/TheCandidStartup/infinisheet/main/packages/react-virtual-scroll/sandboxes/trillion-square-grid?file=%2Findex.js` to launch. 

For internal testing purposes, there's a special `vite.config.js` that allows the samples to be run using Vite. The config forces transpilation of `*.js` files. Use `npx vite --config ../vite.config.js` to start the server in the appropriate sandbox.
